# classroom_scripts
This repository holds simple scripts for interacting with GitHub classroom. I created these scripts for my own usage, and are making them public in case they help someone who is not used to scripting but who wants to use GitHub Classroom.

classroom_clone: Clone all repositories for a given assignment into the current directory

classroom_push: Push changes to all directories in the current directory related to given assignment. There are two options: add a single file and commit/push (use if you create a gradesheet and just want to add it), or commit/push changes to all files in directory that are already added to the repository (use if you edit student code and want those comments to be pushed).
